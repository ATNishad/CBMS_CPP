# Console Message Logger (Pointless and Useless)  

## Overview  
This is a basic console-based message logging system written in C++. It lets users register, log in, and store messages that go absolutely nowhere. There's no actual networking, so calling it a "messaging system" would be a stretch.  

## Why Does This Exist?  
No real reason. It was written for the sake of writing code. If you're here expecting a functional chat application, you're in the wrong place.  

## What It Does (Barely)  
- Users can register and log in (not that it matters).  
- Messages can be written, stored, and "sent" (but only within the local program).  
- Messages can be edited, deleted, searched, and saved to a file (so they can live on in eternal irrelevance).  

## How to Use (If You Really Want To)  
1. Compile the code:  
   ```sh
   g++ filename.cpp -o program.exe
   ```  
2. Run the program:  
   ```sh
   ./program.exe
   ```  
3. Follow the menu and pretend it's a real messaging system.  

## Who Should Use This?  
No one. There's no practical use case. This is just some console-based code floating around with no purpose.
